I.	Installation and Setup

Installing harp:
	./configure

		To use a different sound output (OSS is the default), use:
			./configure --with-jack
			or
			./configure --with-alsa
	make
	make install


Enable the plugins in harp:
	harp -a
		select plugin management:
	Admin> p
		add a plugin:
	Plugins> a
	Library (e.g., libharpmp3): libharpmp3
	Plugins> a
	Library (e.g., libharpmp3): libharpaac
		...

Check that the plugins have been installed:
		list added plugins:
	manage plugins> l

(optional) Create a configuration file:
Note: your paths may be different.
	cp /usr/local/share/harp/defaults.conf ~/.harp/defaults.conf




II.	Manager Interface

	Insert a song into the system. If the insert flag is given with no 
	argument, songs may be entered at the prompt. Inserts may be given with

	directory is given as an argument, HARP will scan the directory
	recursively and add all valid files into the system.
